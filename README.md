# Python Built-in Decorators Example

This repository contains a comprehensive example of custom Python decorators, demonstrating the implementation and usage of `property`, `classmethod`, `staticmethod`, and `wraps` decorators.

## Overview

Decorators in Python are a powerful feature that allow for the modification of functions or methods. This repository showcases how to create custom decorators that mimic the behavior of Python's built-in decorators.

## Contents

- `Staticmethod.py`: Contains a custom implementation of the `builtins.staticmethod` decorator.
- `Classmethod.py`: Contains a custom implementation of the `builtins.classmethod` decorator.
- `Property.py`: Contains a custom implementation of the `builtins.property` decorator.
- `Wraps.py`: Contains a custom implementation of the `functools.wraps` decorator.
- `Example.py`: Contains examples of `Staticmethod`, `Classmethod`, `Property` decorators.


## Usage

Each file contains a class with the decorator implementation and comments explaining the functionality. These can be used as a reference or a starting point for creating your own decorators.
