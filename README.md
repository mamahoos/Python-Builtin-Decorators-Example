# Python Property Decorator
This project is a reimplementation of the built-in `property` decorator in Python. The `property` decorator is a convenient way to create managed attributes in object-oriented programming. This custom implementation aims to provide a deeper understanding of how properties work in Python.

## Example.py
The project includes an Example.py file that demonstrates the usage of the custom property decorator. It provides a sample implementation and shows how the decorator can be applied to a scenario.
