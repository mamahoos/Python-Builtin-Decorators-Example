# Python Property Decorator

This repository contains a reimplementation of the built-in `property` class in Python. The purpose of this project is to provide a better understanding of how the `property` decorator operates and to offer insights into its inner workings.

## Overview

The `property` decorator is a fundamental feature in Python that allows developers to manage attribute access within a class. This custom version of the `property` decorator is written to mimic the behavior of the built-in version, with an emphasis on clarity and educational value.

## Usage

The reimplementation is designed to be used in the same way as the original `property` decorator. It enables the creation of managed attributes, commonly known as "properties," within your Python classes.

## Example.py

For a practical demonstration of how to integrate this custom property decorator into your code, please refer to the `Example.py` file included in this repository. It provides a clear example of the decorator in action.

## Learning Resource

By studying this reimplementation and experimenting with the `Example.py` file, users can gain a deeper appreciation for one of Python's elegant solutions to common object-oriented programming challenges.
